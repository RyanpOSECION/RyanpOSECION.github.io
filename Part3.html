                <p style="color:white"> Dear M,<br>
                    I miss you. <br>
                    I made a mistake. <br>
                    I’m sorry. <br>
                    I should have fought with you. I was weak and I’m sorry. I was immature and afraid of getting close to you. I was afraid of getting hurt again. I was stupid and selfish. I didn’t want to get hurt so I hurt you instead. I got drunk and said things I didn’t mean and for that I am truly sorry. <br>
                    I left at a low point in your life and when you asked if we could try again, I said no and I will never forgive myself for this. I know it’s too late to say this and I don’t expect you to forgive me. I just want you to know that I’m sorry. <br>
                    I do hope that you’re doing well in college. I hope you find new friends, experience new things, and lastly I hope you’re happy ~R <br>
