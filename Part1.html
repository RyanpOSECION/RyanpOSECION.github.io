                <p> Dear M,<br>
                    Hey babe! Happy Valentine’s Day! Hope you have a lovely day. I’m really sorry I couldn’t make it to our date but this letter will have to suffice since I know how much you love long sappy messages. <br>
                    Babe it’s been four months since we started dating and I have to say that I’m truly, wholeheartedly in love with you, my first girlfriend. It seems like yesterday when we went to prom together. I still can’t believe you said yes when I asked you haha I guess having a bouquet of roses and an acoustic guitar really helped. <br>
                    Anyway I just want to say how much I love and appreciate you and your company. When I’m with you, I get butterflies, my heart races, and I feel at ease. <br>
                    I love your hair, how you like to keep it short so that it doesn’t get in the way, I love how you laugh at the weirdest stuff on the internet, I love how you make the worst puns, I love how your voice sounds like an angel, I love how you play bass, I love how you love to draw, but most of all I love seeing you smile. <br>
                    I know that life hasn’t been too kind to you but please know that I’m here for you. I'll be here for you through your depression and way after.I’ll always be here if you need a shoulder to cry on. I love you so much. ~R <br>
