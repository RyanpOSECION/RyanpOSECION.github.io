            <p>Dear M,<br>
                Heyo! How are things with you? I know we haven’t been talking much but hey things are pretty busy around here. How’s senior high? Must be pretty hard considering we’re the first batch right? We’ll be graduating soon though and we’ll be going our separate ways. It’s such a shame though; we had so many good memories. <br>
                Look, I know it didn’t work out between us but hey, we can still be friends right? I mean we still like the same stuff and we laugh at the same weird shit right? I’m sure we’ll work much better as friends right?...right? <br>
                Yeah I’m sorry… it’s just that I’ve got my own demons to face too you know? I have papers to write, quizzes to study for, a thesis to defend. I don’t think we have the time to be couple anymore. It’s better than staying together now and ending it on bad terms and besides, we said that our academics takes priority over our relationship right?...right? <br>
                Anyway, I’ll see you when I see you and I hope we see each other soon! ~R
